# 30 Days of JavaScript Projects

Welcome to my 30 Days of JavaScript Projects challenge! This repository contains 30 small projects built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Each project is designed to help me practice and improve my web development skills.

## Projects Overview
Each project is organized in its own folder. Below is a list of all projects with a brief explanation of what each one does. As I complete each project, I will update this README with more details and links to the project folders and the reference video.
